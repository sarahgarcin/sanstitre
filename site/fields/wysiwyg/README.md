## Installation

If not already existing, add a new `fields` folder to your `site` directory. Then copy or link the entire `wysiwyg` folder there. Afterwards, your directory structure should look like this:

```
site/
	fields/
		wysiwyg/
			assests/
			vendor/
			wysiwyg.php
```

*Optional: Set some configuration options for Kirby WYSIWYG Editor in your sites `config.php` file. You can get an overview of all available options further down.*

## Usage

As soon as you dropped the field extension into your fields folder you can use it in your blueprints: simply replace the `textarea` fields with `wysiwyg` fields (where applicable).

```
fields:
	richtext:
		label: Text
		type:  wysiwyg
```

As content you create using Kirby WYSIWYG Editor is converted into valid markdown, there's nothing you have to change in your templates. Just use the `wysiwyg` content fields like your previous `textarea` fields:

```php
<article>
	<h1><?= $page->title()->html() ?></h1>

	<!-- Just render your WYSIWYG Editor fields
	     like any other Kirbytext field. -->
	<?= $page->richtext()->kirbytext() ?>

</acticle>
```

## Global Options

The Kirby WYSIWYG Editor Field has some global options that you might want to use to alter the fields functionality to suit your specific needs. Below you'll find a list of all available options which can be set from your projects global `config.php` file.

### field.wysiwyg.buttons

Define a list of buttons to display in the editor toolbar. Currently supported button types are: `header1`, `header2`, `bold`, `italic`, `anchor`, `quote`, `unorderedlist`, `orderedlist`, `subscript`, `superscript`, `del`, `ins` and `mark`. Please note that the order in which you list the button names relates to the display order in the toolbar.

### field.wysiwyg.heading-style

Define your preferred heading style. Choose between `setext` (underlined) or `atx` (# Heading 1 and ## Heading 2). Please note that this only affects H1 and H2 headings. All headings of lower priority will always use the ATX style.

## Per Field Options

In addition to the global options explained above, the field offers some options that can be set from a per field basis directly from your blueprints. Please note that these per field options always overwrite global options you might have specified.

### buttons

Define a list of buttons to display in the editor toolbar. Currently supported button types are: `header1`, `header2`, `bold`, `italic`, `anchor`, `quote`, `unorderedlist`, `orderedlist`, `subscript`, `superscript`, `del`, `ins` and `mark`. Please note that the order in which you list the button names relates to the display order in the toolbar.

```
fields:
	richtext:
		label: Text
		type:  wysiwyg
		buttons:
			- bold
			- italic
			- anchor
```

### headingstyle

Define your preferred heading style. Choose between `setext` (underlined) or `atx` (# Heading 1 and ## Heading 2). Please note that this only affects H1 and H2 headings. All headings of lower priority will always use the ATX style.

```
fields:
	richtext:
		label: Text
		type:  wysiwyg
		headingstyle: setext
```

### doublereturns

Choose to allow or disallow two (or more) subsequent empty new lines.

```
fields:
	richtext:
		label: Text
		type:  wysiwyg
		doublereturns: false
```

### firstheader

Choose the heading priority to use as Heading 1 (H1 in the editor toolbar). This can be any HTML heading tag priority (possible values are `h1` to `h6`).

```
fields:
	richtext:
		label: Text
		type:  wysiwyg
		firstheader: h2
```

### secondheader

Choose the heading priority to use as Heading 2 (H2 in the editor toolbar). This can be any HTML heading tag priority (possible values are `h1` to `h6`) though you should obviously choose a value lower then your *firstheader* setting.

```
fields:
	richtext:
		label: Text
		type:  wysiwyg
		secondheader: h3
```

## Known Issues

**Panel Keyboard Shortcuts**

Right now, the panels keyboard shortcuts (*f* to upload a file, *g* for global search) interfere with the Medium Editor Field. Of course, the execution of the shortcuts will be omitted when you (= the user) have an input element, like `<input>`, `<textarea>`, etc focussed. However, the Medium Editor Field uses a brand new HTML5 technology called "contenteditable" elements. This way, you don't write your content inside one of those known `<input>` elements and the panel doesn't know it should not fire the shortcut actions.

We already submitted a [bug report](https://github.com/getkirby/panel/issues/347) and a [pull request](https://github.com/getkirby/panel/pull/353) to the makers of Kirby and this issue will be fixed with the next update. **But in the meantime, we implemented a quick fix to make the WYSIWYG Field work as expected.** It will be applied automatically; you don't have to do any file modifications on your own.

*If you want to know in detail how and why this fix works, please have a look at `wysiwyg/assets/js/bugfix.js`. You'll find some more information there.*
